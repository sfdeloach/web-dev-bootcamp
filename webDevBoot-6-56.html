            <p>Our next three moves are sitting here and waiting. This here's the job buddy. Ain't all super models and speed boats, you know. Not a lot happening stateside. Hearing rumblings about some big play down south. Lots of bodies apparently. Y'know even by Cartel standards. We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones.</p>
            <p>I mean we're definitely not talking, you know, bathtub crank here, this is a big ass operation. You know, hundred of pounds a week, maybe more. Other than the fact that he's deader than a Texas salad bar and has a decent set of pipes, I'd say he's my guy. There's this mystery man I've been chasing for the better part of a year. Cooks the purest meth that uh me or anyone else has ever seen. Goes by the name of Heisenberg. Yeah, pretty weird, huh?</p>
            <p>I looked him up it was one of these physicists, one of Hitler's guys, physicist named Werner Heisenberg - real cute huh? Anyway, I figure with a handle like that my guy's gotta be some sort of a, some sort of an of egg head. No offense. And here we go, Gale 'Major Tom' Boetticher. Anyway, I just wanna see if I'm you know, not barking up the wrong tree chemically speaking. Uh, as far as I can make out, he's writing about a phenylacetone cook, right? That's pretty rare these days, but it does jive with the blue stuff I've been tracking.</p>

            <p>Walter, you've been busy. You wanna put your arms out to the sides for me if you would? You know I haven't slept since Thursday? I was out all night cleaning up after you. I need my sleep. Mmm... yeah, funny how words can be so open to interpretation. You get your car fixed? You're gonna want to get your car fixed.</p>
            <p>You... are trouble. I'm sorry the kid here doesn't see it, but I sure as hell do. You are a time bomb. Tick, tick, ticking. And I have no intention of being around for the boom. Well... you know how they say, it's been a pleasure? It hasn't.</p>
            <p>Once you call it in, the people who show up with be with the office of medical investigations. it's primarily who you'll talk to. Police officers may arrive they may not, depends on how busy a morning they're having. Typically ODs are not a high priority call. There's nothing here to incriminate you, so I'd be amazed if you got placed under arrest. However, if you do, you say nothing. You tell them you just want your lawyer. And you call Saul Goodman.</p>

            <h2>Gus Fring</h2>
            <p>You are done. Fired. Do not show your face at the laundry again. Stay away from Pinkman. Do not go near him. Ever. Are you listening to me? What do you say? For now, but he'll come around. In the meantime there's the matter of your brother-in-law. He is a problem you promised to resolve. You have failed. Now is left to me. To deal with him. If you try to interfere, this becomes a much simpler matter. I will kill your wife, I will kill your son, I will kill your infant daughter.</p>
            <p>Do you know what's happening upstairs? This is all a result of your former partner. Do you understand now? Do you see why this can't continue? There will be an appropriate response.</p>
            <p>Tyrus told me what's happening - the sick child. I understand your preoccupation, but Jesse, I am running a business. I need you back at the lab to complete the cook. You can return when you're done. It is, as you must know, in both of our best interests.</p>
