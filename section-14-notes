142. Introduction to Events

    - Events are everywhere (click, mouseover, drag, drop, keypress)
    - Select an element, then add event listener
    - element.addEventListener(type, function)
    - You can have more than one listener on an element
    - An example of a for loop was used to assign a change color function
      to three <li> elements.  Instead of refering to the element in the
      iterative sense (ie. list[i]), the keywork 'this' was used instead,
      see webDevBoot-14-142.html for an example
