# blog-demo

A simple blog with an ability to create a title, blog body, and image.  Entries
are auto time stamped.

### features:

* mongo / express / semantic-ui / node
* RESTful API
* full CRUD features on blog entries
* NO authentication

### extra credit:

Program a hard and soft delete button.  The hard delete will permanently remove
the blog entry from the database.  The soft delete will give the appearance that
a blog can be deleted, however, it is not truly removed from the database. It 
simply no longer appears in the index.
